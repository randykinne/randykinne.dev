## School

School started yesterday. I've switched from all online classes to some online classes in hopes that it will motivate me.

## Jail

Also, a week ago, my best friend went to jail. I'm not sure what's going to happen, but if I had to guess, it's going to be a date that I won't forget soon.

## Software Engineering

I've just spent 24 hours trying to solve a problem that took 1 line of code to fix. Incredible.
