 **TIL**

 TIL (short for *today, I learned*) is going to be a daily blog where I briefly write about something I've learned. 
 
 **Why?**

 I tried writing longer blog posts, but writing is hard. The easiest way to get through it is to get started. By keeping the criteria both highly achievable and open-ended (a single thing that I've learned on any given day about any topic), hopefully it becomes easier.

 My larger goal is to write longer blog posts to really dive into topics, but I'm hoping that will be easier as I iterate through this. It's also likely that daily TIL posts will give me plenty of ideas to choose from to dive into.
