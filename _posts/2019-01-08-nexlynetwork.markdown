 ## Nexly Network

 **Game server software written in kotlin that allows custom game experiences in Minecraft**

I started creating "plug-ins" for Minecraft servers back in 2014, and created my own server with these custom "plug-ins" in 2015. After the server experienced little success and I was having more fun in high school, I lost interest and stopped. Recently, I decided to get back in touch with some old contacts that had helped me along the way, and that's when I found out about Nexly.

### Minecade

In 2014, I used to play on a server called Minecade. The server had unique games and a very large player-base. I was a moderator for the staff team, and the server and website recieved millions of views. The server always seemed like it was run by the government, though. Updates and development was **slow**. It seemed like every update had to be meticulously tested and then approved by almost everybody before it was *maybe* put on the server. And then it still wasn't satisfactory. Adding on to the turtle-pace of development, the owners were based in Mexico. Language barriers can make everything more difficult. The server eventually fell out of favor among players, and by 2016 was considered "dead." The server itself was on and working, but nobody would play. The game recieved no updates and had fallen stale.

### The start of Nexly

Fast forward to 2018. Now in college, I had not touched Minecraft in over 2.5 years. I became interested in what had happened to Minecade, and decided to get in touch with some friends that I had made during my time at Minecade. That's when I found out that just a week prior, the entire staff team at Minecade had quit when new ownership refused to update or support the games on Minecade. Beyond that, the ownership had mistreated the volunteer staff team as well. They decided to start Nexly Network, a server featuring the games that Minecade had left in shambles.

### My old friends

While checking it out, I realized that I already knew the developers of this server. It was the exact people I had been working with back in 2015 on my own game server. After some brief dialogue, I asked if they wanted some help. They accepted. I then began working on new versions of the code for the game that I had played as a kid.
