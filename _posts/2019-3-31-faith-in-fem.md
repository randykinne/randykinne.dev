 **Faith in Femininity Website**

> Faith in Femininity is a teen-led mission dedicated to giving impoverished women power over their periods.

The idea for a new Faith in Femininity website started as an exploration to utilize GitHub pages and GitHub student developer pack to create free websites. After exploring the possibility, my great friend Lindsey Gibb and I worked closely for 3 months on the website and various features. 

The new site features a beautiful and responsive 1-page site focused on ease of use, readability, and speed.
