 **twitter-subreddit-bot**

After many reddit users on the r/DetroitRedWings subreddit posted about prospects, I decided to combine my love for the game of hockey and my passion for writing code into a single project called DRWProspectBot. This has since evolved into twitter-subreddit-bot, an attempt to make the project more useful.
